In the end I decided to make him a breakfast roll with proper bacon/rashers, from the loin, and not that unhealthy belly pork ye use.  That nice Canadian Bacon is from the loin also - ( 1:0  to Canadians).   Threw in some proper sausages, and some black pudding, butter, loads of ketchup, on a large baguette.

I missed being on WSB, but I was content having a home.\n\nWhen I had a chance to check my surroundings, I came to learn just how smooth brained I was. I am used to crayons and bananas, but these apes spoke of candles and cups with handles. Many spoke with words that hurt my small brain, but they all seemed to be convinced that the reckoning was at hand. I spent my time reading and learning, trying to understand GME in a way I never understood before.\n\nI am still a smooth brained ape, but I hope that I can share some of the knowledge those wrinkle brained Apes taught me.\n\n**Corno4825, what did you learn?**\n\nSHITs can manipulate GME through ETFs. ETFs are essentially stocks that represent a collection of stocks. How this works is that there are people who will buy and sell shares of the stocks that comprise the ETF when someone buys or sells the ETF. The strategy involves shorting the ETF, but buying all of the stocks that comprise the ETF except for GME. The people who manage the ETF will sell the stocks including GME. The net change is that only GME is sold. It's complicated, but I've seen the math and charts and am convinced that this works.\n\nThat was the attack that we saw yesterday even though GME was on the SSR list. However, that ammunition is also limited and those shorts also have to be bought back in. With the recovery the GME made yesterday following the attack, I believe it is in a much stronger squeeze position strictly because of the amount of shorts that were used that need to be bought back in.\n\nThere are many wrinkle brained Apes that believe that the total shorts in circulation equal over 200% of the float. There is a lot of math involved which I do not understand, but many other wrinkle brained Apes agreed with the assessment. There was also a post from a Bloomberg Terminal that showed that Institutions by themselves held 115% of Gamestop shares.\n\n**Corno4825, what does this mean?**\n\n* Millions of shorts still need to be covered.\n* The SHITs are running out of ammo.\n* Stimulus checks still haven't kicked in.\n* Earnings report is coming next week.\n* GME is still up over $150 from where it was 3 weeks ago.\n* If you're still holding on after everything you've experienced the past week, what could possibly scare you now?": 'GME GME GME GME GME GME GME ', 'Buy puts and wait for the drop.': '', 'It means stock is most likely HEAVILY shorted.

Why weren't you on WSB?**\n\nI thought I got myself banned from WSB, so I made my comments elsewhere. I wasn't banned, I just had something in my post that forced it to get autoremoved. There is no conspiracy. WSB mods did nothing wrong. They reached out to me and told me they enjoy my comments. I'm just really smooth brained. I'm going to be more careful about what types of links I put in my posts.\n\n**Wow, you're really smooth brained, but where did you go?**\n\nMy fellow Apes, on Monday, I came to spread the good word, but found that my words were not heard. I figured that my time on WSB was done, so I ventured into other parts of Reddit to find a new home. What I found was a small city of wrinkle brained apes dedicated to GME. Their Daily Megathread recommended that comments like mine be their own separate posts, so I made my own post. Everything was normal, except for my new surroundings. Many of my usual apes were able to find me and I made some new ape friends along the way. I missed being on WSB, but I was content having a home.\n\nWhen I had a chance to check my surroundings, I came to learn just how smooth brained I was. I am used to crayons and bananas, but these apes spoke of candles and cups with handles. Many spoke with words that hurt my small brain, but they all seemed to be convinced that the reckoning was at hand. I spent my time reading and learning, trying to understand GME in a way I never understood before.\n\nI am still a smooth brained ape, but I hope that I can share some of the knowledge those wrinkle brained Apes taught me.\n\n**Corno4825, what did you learn?**\n\nSHITs can manipulate GME through ETFs. ETFs are essentially stocks that represent a collection of stocks. How this works is that there are people who will buy and sell shares of the stocks that comprise the ETF when someone buys or sells the ETF. The strategy involves shorting the ETF, but buying all of the stocks that comprise the ETF except for GME. The people who manage the ETF will sell the stocks including GME. The net change is that only GME is sold. It's complicated, but I've seen the math and charts and am convinced that this works.\n\nThat was the attack that we saw yesterday even though GME was on the SSR list. However, that ammunition is also limited and those shorts also have to be bought back in. With the recovery the GME made yesterday following the attack, I believe it is in a much stronger squeeze position strictly because of the amount of shorts that were used that need to be bought back in.\n\nThere are many wrinkle brained Apes that believe that the total shorts in circulation equal over 200% of the float. There is a lot of math involved which I do not understand, but many other wrinkle brained Apes agreed with the assessment. There was also a post from a Bloomberg Terminal that showed that Institutions by themselves held 115% of Gamestop shares.\n\n**Corno4825, what does this mean?**\n\n* Millions of shorts still need to be covered.\n* The SHITs are running out of ammo.\n* Stimulus checks still haven't kicked in.\n* Earnings report is coming next week.\n* GME is still up over $150 from where it was 3 weeks ago.\n* If you're still holding on after everything you've experienced the past week, what could possibly scare you now?": 'GME GME GME GME GME GME GME GME GME ', 'Can you explain why?': '', 'Don‚Äôt forget: if you just got your stimmy there‚Äôs a St.Patrick‚Äôs day BOGO coupon in the stock market today.

I believe that\'s because hedge funds are exiting their short positions because they know something big is going to happen coming up. Either leading up to the merger date or on the merger date, and they don\'t want to be caught paying more than they have to when the price moons.\n\nThe shorts exiting also explains how the price got so low earlier this month and is lowering again today, possibly even lower. \n\nTwo important dates:\n\nApril 12, voting on the merger takes place\n\nOn or about April 20, the merger is completed \n\nI would wait to see how low it gets today before buying in. It got as low as \\~13 the last time Jpow spoke so it\'s worth waiting to see how low it can go so you can buy in. Regardless, if it stays around $20 ‚Äì $18, I personally would still buy in.\n\nI believe APHA is going to moon after the voting confirms the merge, leading up to the merger date, or on or before the merger date. Either way something big is going to happen.\n\nThis is not financial advice.\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-apha-options-data-report-2021-03/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-apha-options-data-report-2021-03/)': 'A APHA APHA ', 'Look at his Twitter feed.

I just had to cut my shares because the stock price went up so much.\'"\n"\'I‚Äôm taking losses, but I think this f---er‚Äôs going back down to 10 bucks. I‚Äôm going to win eventually; it‚Äôs just a matter of me having the backbone to stay with the trade.\'"\nCase in point: Short sellers increased their bearish bets against companies that have gone public through special purpose acquisition vehicles (SPACs) to more than triple their value at the start of the year, rising to about $2.7 billion from $724 million, WSJ reported Sunday, citing S3 Partners\' data.\n\nBut it\'s not just SPACs that these short sellers ‚Äî mainly hedge funds ‚Äî are targeting. They\'re increasingly putting down bets that broader indexes, like the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Russell 3000 will decline.\nBy the numbers: Short bets against the S&amp;P rose 10.2% from the end of 2020 to March 15, touching a recent high of $521.1 billion, S3\'s data show.\n\nShort interest as a percentage of the S&amp;P\'s total float declined by 7.8% during that time.\n"Traders are betting one $100 chip on the short side instead of five $10 dollar chips," Dusaniwsky says.\nThe bottom line: Having amassed searing losses and public embarrassment and facing a euphoric bull market, Wall Street\'s so-called smart money continues to pile into short bets and has shown no sign of stopping or even slowing down.': 'AMC ', 'Haven‚Äôt been paying attention.

Inflation will BOOM! There is no denying it. The latest CPI was bs. That number is incredibly manipulated (do some googling, the gov has many reasons to make the public think it\'s lower than real inflation rate). Economy is reopening, businesses coming back, and the stock market is at all time highs (not coming out of lows from a broken economy, which it should be). This market will absolutely crash 40-50% if the fed waits until we see high inflation (4%+ is in the cards), we overheat, and they are forced to dramatically raise rates. If they hint at raising rates earlier than expected (late 2022 even possible) we\'re going to start selling off. If JPOW pretends everything is fine while they continue to create this monster, we\'re going to start selling off as yields rise and markets continue to call BS on the fed\'s lack of judgement.
