I was trying to decide whether to feed him a chicken fillet roll (that\'s right, "chicken fillet roll", like that thing ye call a Chicken Tender Sub, which ye stole from us and renamed).  In the end I decided to make him a breakfast roll with proper bacon/rashers, from the loin, and not that unhealthy belly pork ye use.  That nice Canadian Bacon is from the loin also - ( 1:0  to Canadians).   Threw in some proper sausages, and some black pudding, butter, loads of ketchup, on a large baguette.

This will hopefully be easier to follow. If you want to know where I've been the past 2 days, read below! Updates will now be at the top of the post. I will transition this post to the GME Megathread when it comes up.\n\nPremarket shows a slight dip from close yesterday. This doesn't seem to be the same sort of attack at premarket yesterday, but it's still early. \n\nShorts Available: 400,000\n\nCurrent Price: 201.00\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n**Corno4825, what happened? Why weren't you on WSB?**\n\nI thought I got myself banned from WSB, so I made my comments elsewhere. I wasn't banned, I just had something in my post that forced it to get autoremoved. There is no conspiracy. WSB mods did nothing wrong. They reached out to me and told me they enjoy my comments. I'm just really smooth brained. I'm going to be more careful about what types of links I put in my posts.\n\n**Wow, you're really smooth brained, but where did you go?**\n\nMy fellow Apes, on Monday, I came to spread the good word, but found that my words were not heard. I figured that my time on WSB was done, so I ventured into other parts of Reddit to find a new home. What I found was a small city of wrinkle brained apes dedicated to GME. Their Daily Megathread recommended that comments like mine be their own separate posts, so I made my own post. Everything was normal, except for my new surroundings. Many of my usual apes were able to find me and I made some new ape friends along the way. I missed being on WSB, but I was content having a home.\n\nWhen I had a chance to check my surroundings, I came to learn just how smooth brained I was. I am used to crayons and bananas, but these apes spoke of candles and cups with handles. Many spoke with words that hurt my small brain, but they all seemed to be convinced that the reckoning was at hand. I spent my time reading and learning, trying to understand GME in a way I never understood before.\n\nI am still a smooth brained ape, but I hope that I can share some of the knowledge those wrinkle brained Apes taught me.\n\n**Corno4825, what did you learn?**\n\nSHITs can manipulate GME through ETFs. ETFs are essentially stocks that represent a collection of stocks. How this works is that there are people who will buy and sell shares of the stocks that comprise the ETF when someone buys or sells the ETF. The strategy involves shorting the ETF, but buying all of the stocks that comprise the ETF except for GME. The people who manage the ETF will sell the stocks including GME. The net change is that only GME is sold. It's complicated, but I've seen the math and charts and am convinced that this works.\n\nThat was the attack that we saw yesterday even though GME was on the SSR list. However, that ammunition is also limited and those shorts also have to be bought back in. With the recovery the GME made yesterday following the attack, I believe it is in a much stronger squeeze position strictly because of the amount of shorts that were used that need to be bought back in.\n\nThere are many wrinkle brained Apes that believe that the total shorts in circulation equal over 200% of the float. There is a lot of math involved which I do not understand, but many other wrinkle brained Apes agreed with the assessment. There was also a post from a Bloomberg Terminal that showed that Institutions by themselves held 115% of Gamestop shares.\n\n**Corno4825, what does this mean?**\n\n* Millions of shorts still need to be covered.\n* The SHITs are running out of ammo.\n* Stimulus checks still haven't kicked in.\n* Earnings report is coming next week.\n* GME is still up over $150 from where it was 3 weeks ago.\n* If you're still holding on after everything you've experienced the past week, what could possibly scare you now?": ' GME ', 'It means stock is most likely HEAVILY shorted.

Why weren't you on WSB?**\n\nI thought I got myself banned from WSB, so I made my comments elsewhere. I wasn't banned, I just had something in my post that forced it to get autoremoved. There is no conspiracy. WSB mods did nothing wrong. They reached out to me and told me they enjoy my comments. I'm just really smooth brained. I'm going to be more careful about what types of links I put in my posts.\n\n**Wow, you're really smooth brained, but where did you go?**\n\nMy fellow Apes, on Monday, I came to spread the good word, but found that my words were not heard. I figured that my time on WSB was done, so I ventured into other parts of Reddit to find a new home. What I found was a small city of wrinkle brained apes dedicated to GME. Their Daily Megathread recommended that comments like mine be their own separate posts, so I made my own post. Everything was normal, except for my new surroundings. Many of my usual apes were able to find me and I made some new ape friends along the way. I missed being on WSB, but I was content having a home.\n\nWhen I had a chance to check my surroundings, I came to learn just how smooth brained I was. I am used to crayons and bananas, but these apes spoke of candles and cups with handles. Many spoke with words that hurt my small brain, but they all seemed to be convinced that the reckoning was at hand. I spent my time reading and learning, trying to understand GME in a way I never understood before.\n\nI am still a smooth brained ape, but I hope that I can share some of the knowledge those wrinkle brained Apes taught me.\n\n**Corno4825, what did you learn?**\n\nSHITs can manipulate GME through ETFs. ETFs are essentially stocks that represent a collection of stocks. How this works is that there are people who will buy and sell shares of the stocks that comprise the ETF when someone buys or sells the ETF. The strategy involves shorting the ETF, but buying all of the stocks that comprise the ETF except for GME. The people who manage the ETF will sell the stocks including GME. The net change is that only GME is sold. It's complicated, but I've seen the math and charts and am convinced that this works.\n\nThat was the attack that we saw yesterday even though GME was on the SSR list. However, that ammunition is also limited and those shorts also have to be bought back in. With the recovery the GME made yesterday following the attack, I believe it is in a much stronger squeeze position strictly because of the amount of shorts that were used that need to be bought back in.\n\nThere are many wrinkle brained Apes that believe that the total shorts in circulation equal over 200% of the float. There is a lot of math involved which I do not understand, but many other wrinkle brained Apes agreed with the assessment. There was also a post from a Bloomberg Terminal that showed that Institutions by themselves held 115% of Gamestop shares.\n\n**Corno4825, what does this mean?**\n\n* Millions of shorts still need to be covered.\n* The SHITs are running out of ammo.\n* Stimulus checks still haven't kicked in.\n* Earnings report is coming next week.\n* GME is still up over $150 from where it was 3 weeks ago.\n* If you're still holding on after everything you've experienced the past week, what could possibly scare you now?": ' GME ', 'Don’t forget: if you just got your stimmy there’s a St.Patrick’s day BOGO coupon in the stock market today.

I believe that\'s because hedge funds are exiting their short positions because they know something big is going to happen coming up. Either leading up to the merger date or on the merger date, and they don\'t want to be caught paying more than they have to when the price moons.\n\nThe shorts exiting also explains how the price got so low earlier this month and is lowering again today, possibly even lower. \n\nTwo important dates:\n\nApril 12, voting on the merger takes place\n\nOn or about April 20, the merger is completed \n\nI would wait to see how low it gets today before buying in. It got as low as \\~13 the last time Jpow spoke so it\'s worth waiting to see how low it can go so you can buy in. Regardless, if it stays around $20 – $18, I personally would still buy in.\n\nI believe APHA is going to moon after the voting confirms the merge, leading up to the merger date, or on or before the merger date.

I just had to cut my shares because the stock price went up so much.\'"\n"\'I’m taking losses, but I think this f---er’s going back down to 10 bucks. I’m going to win eventually; it’s just a matter of me having the backbone to stay with the trade.\'"\nCase in point: Short sellers increased their bearish bets against companies that have gone public through special purpose acquisition vehicles (SPACs) to more than triple their value at the start of the year, rising to about $2.7 billion from $724 million, WSJ reported Sunday, citing S3 Partners\' data.\n\nBut it\'s not just SPACs that these short sellers — mainly hedge funds — are targeting. They\'re increasingly putting down bets that broader indexes, like the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Russell 3000 will decline.\nBy the numbers: Short bets against the S&amp;P rose 10.2% from the end of 2020 to March 15, touching a recent high of $521.1 billion, S3\'s data show.\n\nShort interest as a percentage of the S&amp;P\'s total float declined by 7.8% during that time.\n"Traders are betting one $100 chip on the short side instead of five $10 dollar chips," Dusaniwsky says.\nThe bottom line: Having amassed searing losses and public embarrassment and facing a euphoric bull market, Wall Street\'s so-called smart money continues to pile into short bets and has shown no sign of stopping or even slowing down.': ' AMC ', 'Haven’t been paying attention.
