As the stock spiked on Wednesday, short interest continued to fall, perhaps after short-sellers learned their lesson in the late January squeeze, losing billions.\nBut according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue.\n“We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.”\nShort interest may have fallen, but it’s still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn’t count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer here.)\nTo put this into context, fellow meme stock AMC Entertainment has a short interest percentage of float of 17.32%. Tesla, another famously shorted company, is at 5.98%, and Amazon at 1.03%.\n“This has not been a profitable trading week for GME short sellers, after being down -$1.36 billion on Monday and Tuesday,” Dusaniwsky said. “[Wednesday’s] +7% price move added another -$202 million in additional mark-to-market losses.”\nAll in, GameStop shorts have now lost $6.8 billion year-to-date, Dusaniwsky said.": ' GME ', 'HOLY MOLY GME PREMARKET': ' GME ', 'My average GME stonk is $800.

Only you can answer that question for yourself. Here are the questions you should ask yourself with any investment.\n\n1) What is the thesis behind your investment?\n\n* Why did you invest? What makes you believe that the stock is actually more valuable than it's current price? If you don't know why you you're investing, how do you expect to know when to make moves?\n\n* There is a lot of DD on GME. Read that DD and then do your own DD and decide why you're actually invested.\n\n2) Has the information changed?\n\n* If a stock price changes, did it change because of general volatility or because there is some new information out there? Remember that not everyone processes information at the same time, so some changes in information may take time to process in the actual price of the stock.\n\n* A lot of people post their thoughts on GME, but you have to ask if your personal thesis on GME changed yet? \n\n3) What is your exit strategy?\n\n* At what point will you move on from your investment?\n\n* At what price do you want to sell GME?\n \n**Corno4825, what is the purpose of your thread?**\n\nIf you're looking to me to decide on what to do with GME, please realize that I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. All of the thoughts, ideas, and information I post are thoughts, ideas, and information that you can come up with with yourself. I don't have insider knowledge on GME. I don't work at an investment firm. I haven't even been in the stock market for a year. \n\nI have YOLO'd all $2,000 I have into GME. I am fully invested in this stock. I will do everything I can to make money on the way up through the squeeze and on the way down after the squeeze. [I am currently up to $27,000.](http://puu.sh/Hot1X/da5fde54e5.png) What I'm doing is looking at the information presented to me, commenting on what I see, and reading the rest of the reactions around WSB to try and best understand that situation. Once I'm done with GME, I will probably move on to the next big Reddit stock as long as I believe that the thesis is strong and do the same thing there. If I can make enough money investing, I will quit my job and continue to make comments on Reddit until I get bored.\n\nLet's have some fun today.\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n**8:30 Pre-Market Update**\n\nGME is on the SSR again today. Theoretically that means there shouldn't be any attacks. I still think that the SHITs (Shorting Hedge Investors and Traders) have a way to circumvent the SSR, so if we see any major drops today, I'm not going to panic sell.\n\nI still believe that there are a ton of shorts in the wild that need to close, so I believe that the squeeze potential is still on.\n\nIn order for the price to have a major shift today, GME needs to either have some new information come out about it's status, or there needs to be an influx in buying or selling power. Don't be surprised if we have another boring day today. With the SSR in place, it's going to be very difficult for the SHITs to manipulate the stock without serious scrutiny. \n\nPremarket, the price is up, but only a bit above where it ended on Wednesday. Unless anything changes, I'm assuming that ~265 is it's stability point and that any fluctuation around that number is just general volatility.\n\nShorts available: 750,000\n\nCurrent Premarket Price: 269.40": ' GME ', 'Going to double my stake today PLTR and Tesla': ' PLTR ', 'There are ways to only buy a little bit of a share.

I hopped on the GME short squeeze and was able to collect pretty decent gains before it went belly-up.

I assume this is something you guys are talking about in therapy because it is a really important factor in a relationship. \n\nMy GF of 7 years and I have dealt with some similar struggles. She didn't get too much joy from sex which led to both of us not feeling attractive and wanted. She always felt like there were all these expectations she had to live up to so after a while sex became something she would do for me. For her, It was always about making me cum and she didn't really focus on herself. She thought this was the norm and this led to our sex life taking a massive nosedive because it just wasn't as much fun for her. \n\nIf, by chance, you're dutch.. there is a really good documentary about this subject. It's called, mijn seks is stuk (my sex is broken). Maybe you can watch it with subtitles but I can't guarantee the quality of said subtitles. Also this article: https://www.thecut.com/2012/11/i-went-to-a-female-masturbation-class.html\n\nA year ago she told me that she had an emotional affair with someone and that really broke me. I have been an insecure person my entire life and that really felt like the nail in the Coffin at the time. I felt very inadequate and heartbroken. After this we started having a lot of serious conversations. As said before, she didn't really get something out of the sex and my compliments weren't hitting as hard as the compliments the other guy gave her. We talked about what I could do to make her feel the same way. For example, not just saying that she's beautiful but focussing more on things that I think make her beautiful. (E.g. Her lovely smile, her beautiful hair and her perfect little nose). Maybe this is something that could help you guys as well.\n\nAs for the sex, we started focussing way more on her. We bought some New toys to experiment with and we figured out that orgasms shouldn't be the focus of those experiments because it should be more about us finding new ways to make her feel good and help her feel comfortable in her own skin because she was very insecure as well. So maybe this could help you guys as well.\n\nShe also admitted that compliments from other guys made her feel attractive and that it gave her a thrill as well. She felt this way because she thought that if I gave her compliments, I only said those things because we were in a relationship. So taking my compliments seriously, is something she has been working on the last year and we are doing much better now. I don't know if this is the same for you but I felt like it deserved a mention. \n\nAs for the kinky stuff. We found out we both had a kinky side as well. We started of very slowly. Just some hair pulling, soft impact play etc. We are both switches but she is definitely more submissive. In the beginning I was more dominant but after a while I had some submissive itches that needed scratching. At first, she wasn't really into being the dominant and this led to me feeling very unwanted because I didn't get those needs met. So that's why I really understand your feelings and frustrations. We had a long conversation about it and she said that she did want to give it a few more tries. \n\nThis happened only on her terms because I needed to know that she wasn't forcing herself to do anything because this would only lead to more issues down the road. My point here, I guess, is that you should keep in mind that your husband might feel very inadequate as well because of your emotional affair, so make sure that, if you guys ever explore your kinky sides together, he feels comfortable with it as well and that he does it because he wants to, not because of the fear you might leave him if he doesn't. And if it doesn't happen and you still have these cravings, it might just be the end of the road for you guys because this could lead to a lot of resentment down the line. (I know this isn't nice to hear/read, but it is something you should keep in mind) \n\nSorry for the enormous comment, but your story really resonated with me because I feel like I have been in both of your positions. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me and I hope you guys can work it out!": ' GF '}
